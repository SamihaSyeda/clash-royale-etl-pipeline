## Activity 1: Identify the User Stories

### Instructions

1. Work with your team to convert the project requirements below into user stories.
   - The 5 goals above translate into 4 ***epics***
     - These should be broken down into 1 or more user stories, using the format:

    ```plaintext
    As a [role], I want [goal/desire] so that [benefit].
    ```

| Epic                                                 | User Requirements                                                                         |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Epic 1: Data Availability, Quality and Trust         | Analysts need a single, clean dataset combining transaction and demographic data.         |
|                                                      | Data scientists need the cleaned dataset stored in a SQL table for analysis.              |
| Epic 2: Customer Insights                            | Analysts want to analyze spending per customer and identify high-value customers.         |
|                                                      | Business stakeholders would like to identify customers who have spent more than **$500**. |
| Epic 3: Demographic Trends                           | Business stakeholders want insights into age and country trends of key customers.         |
| Epic 4: Data Access and Storage                      | Scientists need assurance that the data is clean, consistent, and accurate.               |
|                                                      | Scientists need the cleaned dataset stored in a SQL table for analysis.                   |
|                                                      | Scientists need to be able to reset and update the data for repeat or future analysis     |

Given these epics and their requirements, create user stories for each epic.  There is a hint as to how many stories are needed and the stakeholders involved in it.
